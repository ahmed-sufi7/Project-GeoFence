			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Project Structure and Core Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project initialization into manageable components: create monorepo structure with separate workspaces for mobile app, admin dashboard, and backend services; configure TypeScript across all packages; set up package.json files with all required dependencies; configure development tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Git hooks); set up environment variable templates; and create basic build scripts for each component.",
			"reasoning": "This is foundational work but relatively straightforward. While it involves multiple technologies (React Native, Next.js, various APIs), it's primarily configuration and setup work. The main complexity comes from ensuring all dependencies are compatible and properly configured across multiple packages."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Supabase Database Schema Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Design and implement the database schema systematically: create core user tables (Users, UserProfiles, EmergencyContacts); implement geospatial tables (Zones, LocationLogs); build safety and incident tracking tables (SafetyScores, Incidents, Alerts); create BitChat P2P network table; set up all foreign key relationships and indexes; implement Row Level Security policies for each table; configure real-time subscriptions; and create database migration scripts.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the comprehensive schema with geospatial data, complex relationships, and security requirements. RLS policies, real-time subscriptions, and geospatial indexing add significant complexity. The schema is foundational and must be designed carefully to support all system features."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Tile38 Geofencing Service Setup and Integration",

			"reasoning": "High complexity due to KYC workflow requirements, document processing, blockchain integration, multi-platform session management, and security considerations. The admin approval workflow and document validation add significant complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "React Native Mobile Application Core Structure",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Develop the mobile app foundation: create React Native/Expo project with TypeScript configuration; implement navigation structure with authenticated and guest flows; build core UI component library with consistent styling; create authentication screens (login, registration, KYC upload); integrate Supabase client for authentication and real-time data; set up location services with background tracking; implement camera integration for KYC documents; and configure push notifications and secure local storage.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate to high complexity due to multiple integrations (Supabase, location services, camera, push notifications) and cross-platform considerations. The background location tracking and secure storage add complexity, but React Native provides good abstractions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Admin Dashboard with Real-time Monitoring",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create comprehensive admin dashboard: build Next.js application with shadcn component integration; implement OpenStreetMap integration with custom overlays; create real-time tourist location tracking with WebSocket connections; build tourist clustering visualization with dynamic sizing; implement heat map rendering for high-risk zones; create zone management interface with polygon drawing tools; and ensure responsive design with real-time data updates every 10-30 seconds.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to real-time mapping requirements, WebSocket management, complex visualizations (clustering, heat maps), and polygon drawing interface. The real-time updates for thousands of users and map performance optimization add significant complexity."
